# Error Handling And Retry Limits

## Purpose

Validation and runtime failures are feedback, not permission for unlimited
edits. This applies to lint, typecheck, build, preview, browser render, network,
and external-resource errors.

The agent may make limited, evidence-based fixes. If the error remains after the
retry limit, stop and explain why.

## General Retry Limits

For any validation or runtime error:

- Reproduce or inspect the exact error before editing.
- Try at most 3 total fix cycles for one task.
- Try at most 2 fixes for the same error family.
- Try at most 1 fix when the error is unrelated to the current task.
- Stop immediately for known non-fixable cases.

An error is the same family when it has the same command, file area, error code,
stack trace pattern, or diagnostic message pattern.

Continue only when there is new concrete evidence, such as console output, lint
diagnostics, a stack trace, network logs, or a specific file location.

Revert a fix that did not change the symptom before trying the next one. Report
the change you verified as the fix, never an unconfirmed hypothesis.

## Browser And Runtime Errors

For browser, runtime, or network render errors:

- Try at most 2 low-risk fixes.
- Try at most 1 fix when the error points to browser compatibility, external
  resources, sandbox policy, or preview-runtime behavior.
- Stop if the same `BROWSER_ERROR_RENDER` appears again.
- Stop if the error does not point to a specific project file.
- Stop if further fixes would require guessing, broad rewrites, or changing the
  build/runtime strategy.

## Allowed Attempts

- Fix an obviously wrong path or import.
- Fix a clear lint, type, or syntax issue in the changed files.
- Replace an unstable external URL.
- Add a simple fallback for resource loading failure.
- Use a more widely supported browser API.
- Adjust module loading only when project code clearly caused the issue.

## Diagnosing A Broken Page

Re-fetch the URL with `?dev` appended, using `read_website_content` or
`browser`. Dev mode server-renders the full render diagnostics into the page,
including the SSR error a normal request hides. Do this before guessing.

A page that shows its own empty or not-found branch, or that lost its
`getServerSideProps` props, while the record exists and the route is right, is
an SSR load failure — not a data bug. Check in order:

1. Bare imports in the page's module graph: a package that is not a platform
   built-in cannot load in SSR (`references/site-code.md` "SSR Availability").
2. `window` / `document` at module scope or during render.
3. The data layer.

`getContent(key, slug)` takes a slug and is not locale-sensitive. Do not swap it
for a `listContents` scan on suspicion.

## Known Non-Fixable Cases

### `Failed to resolve module specifier "react/jsx-dev-runtime"`

```text
Failed to resolve module specifier "react/jsx-dev-runtime"
```

Treat this as a browser/preview-runtime compatibility issue, not project code.
`react/jsx-dev-runtime` is provided by Talizen's built-in React runtime, so it is
not fixed by editing components, routes, styles, or app logic.

Do not rewrite JSX, add fake local modules, or batch-change React imports. Stop
immediately, or after at most one verification attempt.

## Stop Report

When stopping, explain:

- The error code or message.
- What was attempted, if anything.
- Why the agent is stopping.
- Why further code edits are unsafe or unlikely to help.
- For browser errors, ask the user to refresh the page and try again, or use the
  latest Google Chrome browser.
- If needed, ask for the full browser Console log or validation output.

## Forbidden Actions

- Do not keep editing until the command passes.
- Do not rewrite large areas of the app without evidence.
- Do not hide the error or change configuration only to bypass it.
- Do not add fake modules for built-in runtime packages.
- Do not assume every failure is caused by project code.
- Do not continue after the retry limit is reached.
