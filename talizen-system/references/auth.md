# Talizen Auth Usage

Talizen auth is project-scoped platform auth for site visitors. Use the
browser-side `talizen/auth` SDK for login, registration, logout, current-user
state, OAuth/social login, and protected UI.

Do not build auth with Func or JSON tables. Do not store passwords, session
tokens, OAuth tokens, OAuth callback state, or project auth identities in custom
tables.

## Core Rule

React UI must use `useAuth()` for auth state and auth mutations:

```tsx
import { useAuth } from "talizen/auth"

export function AccountBar() {
  const { user, loading, login, register, logout, updateProfile } = useAuth()

  if (loading) return <p>Loading...</p>
  if (!user) return <button onClick={() => login("alice", "secret")}>Sign in</button>

  return <button onClick={() => logout()}>Sign out</button>
}
```

`useAuth()` returns `{ user, loading, error, isAuthenticated, isInitialized,
refresh, login, register, logout, updateProfile }`. Hook mutations update all
subscribers, so UI depending on `useAuth()` refreshes without remounting the
whole app.

Do not import top-level `login` or `logout` from `talizen/auth`; they are not
public SDK exports. Use `useAuth().login()` and `useAuth().logout()` in React
components.

`account` is the login identifier. It does not have to be an email address.

## SSR And Func

`getServerSideProps` does not expose `ctx.auth`. Do not import `talizen/auth`,
and do not call login, registration, logout, current-user reads, or Func from
`getServerSideProps`.

Why: render HTML is cached by route, query, dependencies, and learned
cookie-vary names. A direct auth/user read would make HTML depend on hidden
user-specific state and can break cache safety. Cookie reads are explicit
through `ctx.cookies.get(...)`; cookie writes are no-store.

For protected backend actions, use Func for the business action and read the
signed-in project user with `ctx.auth.currentUser()` or
`ctx.auth.requireUser()`. Func auth is not for implementing login,
registration, logout, or OAuth.

A password-gated page follows the same boundary: render a public gate, verify
through Func/API, set a signed access cookie, then fetch the protected content
from Func/API.

## Registration And Profile

In React UI, prefer `useAuth().register(...)` and
`useAuth().updateProfile(...)` so subscribers update automatically. The
top-level `register(input)` helper exists for low-level non-hook flows only.

Registration requires `account` and `password`; `email`, `phone`, `name`,
`avatar`, and `profile` are optional profile fields.

## OAuth

OAuth providers are configured in project Auth settings. Page code should not
hard-code client secrets, token endpoints, or callback logic.

A provider's configuration is a file: `/backend/auth/<key>.json`, where the file
name is the provider key (`github`, `google`, …). Edit it with the normal file
tools — there are no provider tools:

```json
{
  "name": "GitHub",
  "status": "enable",
  "client_id": "Iv1.xxx",
  "redirect_url": "https://example.com/api/auth/callback/github",
  "scopes": ["user:email"],
  "endpoint": {
    "auth_url": "https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize",
    "token_url": "https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token",
    "userinfo_url": "https://api.github.com/user"
  }
}
```

- **`client_secret` is never in the file** and writing it is rejected — files are
  diffable and get shipped around. After creating a provider this way, tell the
  user to set the secret in the platform console; login stays inactive until then
  (`ready_for_login` shows the current state and is read-only).
- Required on write: `name`, `client_id`, `redirect_url`, and
  `endpoint.auth_url` / `token_url` / `userinfo_url`. All URLs must be http(s).
  `status` is `enable` or `disable`.
- An existing secret is preserved across file writes.
- Renaming is refused; deleting a provider file removes the provider (config
  only, no user data).

```ts
import { getOAuthLoginUrl, listAuthProviders, loginWithOAuth } from "talizen/auth"
```

- `listAuthProviders()` returns enabled providers.
- `loginWithOAuth(provider, { redirectUrl })` redirects the browser to provider
  login.
- `getOAuthLoginUrl(provider, { redirectUrl })` returns a provider login URL
  for custom redirect flows.

`redirectUrl` must be a same-site relative path such as `/account`.
