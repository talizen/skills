# Talizen CSS And Tailwind

Talizen uses Tailwind CSS v4.

## Component Styling

- Use utility classes for component styling.
- Avoid inline `style` props except for genuinely dynamic values that cannot be
  represented with classes or CSS variables.
- Do not add ad-hoc `<style>` tags in page components.
- Do not create arbitrary extra CSS files for one-off component styling.

When adding color transitions, drive the color from one source to avoid double
hover transitions. Either let children inherit the parent color or control the
child color with a single hover or `group-hover` rule.

## Responsive

Reach for the built-in breakpoints (`sm` `md` `lg` `xl` `2xl`) first: the visual
editor's per-breakpoint style controls read those and only those, so a layout
built on them stays editable on the canvas, while a custom cut (`min-[700px]:`,
or a `--breakpoint-*` token in `@theme`) can only be changed in code. Take the
custom cut when the design lands nowhere near a built-in.

Drive width-dependent layout from CSS. The canvas renders several breakpoints as
sibling artboards inside one iframe, so `window.innerWidth`,
`matchMedia('(max-width: …)')`, and resize listeners all measure the iframe
rather than the artboard, and at most one artboard can come out right. Non-width
media queries (`prefers-reduced-motion`, `prefers-color-scheme`) are unaffected.

## Site-Level `index.css`

Use `/index.css` for site-level Tailwind source such as `@theme`, `@utility`,
and base layers. A dedicated site file lets you define theme tokens and custom
utilities without inline styles on every component. This file supports both
plain CSS and Tailwind directives.

Minimal example:

```css
@theme inline {
  --color-brand: #005aa7;
  --color-brand-foreground: #ffffff;
  --radius: 0.75rem;
}

@utility shadow-soft {
  box-shadow: 0 18px 40px -25px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.35);
}

@utility btn-primary {
  background-color: var(--color-brand);
  color: var(--color-brand-foreground);
  padding: 0.75rem 1.25rem;
  border-radius: var(--radius);

  &:hover {
    opacity: 0.92;
  }
}
```
